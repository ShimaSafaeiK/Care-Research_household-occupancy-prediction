# UK-DRI-Care-Research_-household-occupancy-prediction
"A project to predict whether a household is single or multiple occupancy using motion sensor data. Includes data preprocessing, model training with XGBoost, and evaluation using accuracy and F1 score."

**Project Overview**

project aims to predict whether a household is single or multiple occupancy using motion sensor data. This involves:

1.Loading and cleaning the data.

2.Merging sensor data with occupancy labels.

3.Preprocessing and feature engineering.

4.Building and evaluating a predictive model.
